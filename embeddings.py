Constructed and Designed the User Interface using Figma, employing best practices in UX design and incorporating user feedback to enhance usability and boost user satisfaction.  Architected the synchronization between the Application and Backend API, enabling dynamic content updates based on the latest news, driving a 15% growth in daily active users. Leveraged Firebase’s real-time database capabilities to enable dynamic data updates, enhancing the application’s responsiveness and providing users with up-to-date information. Engineered and deployed innovative ‘Tinder-style’ swiping features, granting users the capability to showcase political viewpoints through left/right swipes resulting in a 20% increase in time spent on the app per user. Guided and Mentored a team of 4 through iterative development cycles, by implementing agile methodologies, leading daily stand-ups, and facilitating cross-functional collaboration to deliver the Application on time."

Established the interconnectivity between the various controllers, models, and views that allow the app to search the Google Civic Information API to look up Political Candidates in specific states. Refactored legacy code of an old Application by writing Characterization Tests and then following Red-Green-Refactor principles. Improved Test Coverage of every File in the directory to more than 90% by using Rspec and Cucumber tests."
